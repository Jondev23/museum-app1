# Inactivity Timer Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
The inactivity timer was resetting every time the screen changed instead of only when there was actual user activity. This caused the screensaver to activate every 3 minutes regardless of user interaction.

## Changes Made
1. **Improved useEffect dependency management**: The inactivity timer useEffect now properly manages event listeners and timer state
2. **Added activity logging**: Console log messages when user activity is detected (for debugging)
3. **Enhanced event detection**: Added mousemove and scroll events for better activity detection
4. **Proper cleanup**: Event listeners are properly added and removed to prevent memory leaks

## How to Test

### Expected Behavior (After Fix)
1. **Normal Operation**: Timer should reset to 3 minutes whenever user interacts with the app
2. **Screen Changes**: Changing screens should NOT reset the timer by itself
3. **Screensaver Activation**: Should only happen after 3 minutes of actual inactivity
4. **Activity Detection**: Any touch, click, key press, mouse movement, or scrolling should reset the timer

### Test Steps
1. Start the app and navigate through different screens
2. Note that the timer does NOT reset just from screen changes
3. Interact with the app (touch, click, etc.) and verify the timer resets
4. Leave the app idle for 3 minutes - screensaver should activate
5. Check browser console for "User activity detected, resetting inactivity timer" messages

### Timer Logging
The fix includes console logging to help debug timer behavior:
- Look for "User activity detected, resetting inactivity timer" in browser console
- This confirms the timer is working correctly

## Technical Details
- **useEffect Dependencies**: Changed from `[currentScreen]` to `[currentScreen, goToScreensaver]` with proper logic to handle screen changes
- **Event Management**: Centralized add/remove event listeners in helper functions
- **Activity Guard**: Only reset timer when not on screensaver screen
- **Multiple Event Types**: touchstart, click, keydown, mousemove, scroll
